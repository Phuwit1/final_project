While admiring  the old- fashioned buildings, the fortunate visitor may  spot Geisha  or Maiko (Geisha apprentices) walking between  these  establishments. Finally, at Maruyama Park, we  enjoy the  seasonal Cherry Blossom Light-Up. Maruyama  Park is  one of Kyoto\'s top places to enjoy cherry  blossoms, and  features the beautiful Shidarezakura, or  "Weeping Cherry"  tree. In the evening, the pretty pink flowers are  accented  with bright illumination.

This narrow shopping street, commonly referred  to as  \'Kyoto\'s Kitchen,\' is filled with more than 100  restaurants  and shops that sell all kinds of food-related  items â€“ from  top-of-the-line knives and cookware to  tempting seafood  and produce. We  go from there to tour Nijo  Castle, a  UNESCO World Heritage Site from Japanâ€™s  feudal era,  and former residence of the Tokugawa shogun  known for  its beautifully preserved palace. While you walk  around  the stately Edo-period buildings, listen for the  chirping of  the â€œnightingaleâ€\x9d floors. Next, we view one of  Kyotoâ€™s most  coveted sights â€“ the elegant Golden Pavilion.  The  templeâ€™s shimmering golden walls can be seen  reflected in  the Mirror Pond below, but donâ€™t miss the  dainty phoenix  ornament sitting on the roof! We then visit  Kyoto\'s  beautiful Arashiyama District. Enjoy the beauty  of a local  Bamboo Forest, which is one of Arashiyama\'s  top must- see sights. The thick groves of towering green  bamboo  create a world of otherworldly awe and mystery  as you  walk the path through the center. We also  explore the  enchanting Kimono Forest, which is outside  Arashiyama  Station. Modeled after the local bamboo  groves, the  Kimono Forest features pillars containing many  colors and  patterns of Kimono cloth, for which the city of  Kyoto is  famous. We also take a stroll down the  Togetsukyo Bridge  which was originally built spanning the Hozu  River  hundreds of years ago. Itâ€™s now one of the best  places to  view the natural splendor of Arashiyama.

    Generate a detailed travel itinerary in JSON format. 
            
    The itinerary must include:  
        - **Multiple days** with specific dates (`YYYY-MM-DD`).  
        - **Day labels** (e.g., `"Day 1"`, `"Day 2"`).  
        - **A schedule** for each day, containing: 
        - **Time slots** (`HH:mm`, 24-hour format).  
        - **Activities** for each time slot.
        - **Latitude and longitude** coordinates for each activity (e.g., `"lat": 35.6895`, `"lng": 139.6917`).
        - **lat** and **lng** are the coordinates of the activity location, which can be found on Google Maps or similar services.
        - *** **lat** and **lng** can be empty if the activity is not location-specific (e.g., "Shopping" or "Dining" or "Hotel"). ***
