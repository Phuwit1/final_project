The schedule balances cultural and pop-culture activities with sightseeing, and travel distances are manageable given transportation modes like private coaches, Shinkansen, and walking tours. The weather may affect views at Mt. Fuji and outdoor activities in Hakone. Expo 2025 is a summer event and fits well within this timeframe. Layered clothing and hydration are advised due to summer heat."

    Generate a detailed travel itinerary in JSON format. 
            
    The itinerary must include:  
        - **Multiple days** with specific dates (`YYYY-MM-DD`).  
        - **Day labels** (e.g., `"Day 1"`, `"Day 2"`).  
        - **A schedule** for each day, containing: 
        - **Time slots** (`HH:mm`, 24-hour format).  
        - **Activities** for each time slot.
        - **Latitude and longitude** coordinates for each activity (e.g., `"lat": 35.6895`, `"lng": 139.6917`).
        - **lat** and **lng** are the coordinates of the activity location, which can be found on Google Maps or similar services.
        - *** **lat** and **lng** can be empty if the activity is not location-specific (e.g., "Shopping" or "Dining" or "Hotel"). ***
        
        - **Comments** or additional notes about the itinerary **example about the season for example, is that month suitable for that kind of weather? Like going to see cherry blossoms in a month when they're not blooming. ** here is season data {season_data}.
